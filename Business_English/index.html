                문제1 work routine<br>
                1. I want clock in and clock out in same time on every day. I like regular life, and get balance for work and life.<br>
                2. I don't want to get shift work. Sleeping over 8 hours in night is most important for me, but shift worker cannot have routine sleep. Espectically, graveyard shift is worst.<br>

                4. I want some regular break. Breaking a few time might help to work efficiently.<br>
                5. I want to commute to work. Because I want to seperate my home and my workplace.<br><br>

                문제3 rank of attractiveness job benefits<br>
                I think health care is best. When I get older, I have to get regular health check at big hospital, but it's too expensive.<br>
                In real, my father get health check every year for free because of company's benefit, and he knew that he got something wrong on his stomach. Without health check, he maybe don't know this! So, I want health care for company's benefit.<br><br>
